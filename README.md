## :scroll: Description
Application is about Puppy Adoption, first page displays list of puppies from local data source,
clicking on which opens a detail page with form to request for adoption included some animations.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
Using Jetpack compose Animations to create slide_in effect for detail screen and
using kenburnsview to transform image once every 2 frames is something interesting in this case.
Used annotatedStrings, SnackBar, gradients and Bottomsheet like design for detail screen.
