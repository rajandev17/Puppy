## :scroll: Description
Application is about Puppy Adoption, first page displays list of puppies from local data source,
clicking on which opens a detail page with form to request for adoption, also included some animations.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
Using Jetpack compose Animations to create slide_in effect for detail screen and
using kenburnsview to transform image once every 2 frames is something I found interesting which also helped me understand how composition works.
Used annotatedStrings, SnackBar, gradients and bottom sheet like design for detail screen.
